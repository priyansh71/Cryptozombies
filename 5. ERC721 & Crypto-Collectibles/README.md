## crypto-collectibles

- ERC721 tokens are not interchangeable since each one is assumed to be unique, and are not divisible. You can only trade them in whole units, and each one has a unique ID. So these are a perfect fit for making our zombies tradeable.
- ```Note``` : Using a standard like ERC721 has the benefit that we don't have to implement the auction or escrow logic within our contract that determines how players can trade/sell our zombies. If we conform to the spec, someone else could build an exchange platform for crypto-tradable ERC721 assets, and our ERC721 zombies would be usable on that platform. So there are clear benefits to using a token standard instead of rolling your own trading logic.
- Make sure users don't accidentally transfer their zombies to address 0 (which is called "burning" a token â€” basically it's sent to an address that no one has the private key of, essentially making it unrecoverable)
